# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Data

## Background Information
Cyclistic is a bike-share company where people can rent bikes either as a casual rider or through an annual membership. Casual riders can obtain either single-ride passes or full day passes. Annual members pay an annual fee that allows them to rent a bike whenever they need throughout the year. Through an internal review finance analysts at Cyclistic determined that it is more profitable to the company to have annual members rather than casual riders. The director of marketing determined the best course of action to maximize profit would be to start a marketing campaign to target already existing casual riders to convert them to annual members as opposed to trying to target new customers. This project goes through the steps of a data analyst taking Cyclisticâ€™s raw user data and transforming it into a meaningful plan of action to convert casual riders into annual members. 

## Business Task
Since annual memberships are more profitable to the company, we need to determine the differences between how casual riders and annual members use the Cyclistic bike-share program differently. We will then use this information to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

## How Reliable is the Data
In this case study, Cyclistic is a fictional company, because of this, the raw data we will be using is historical data from a real bike-share company called Divvy. This is a public dataset and privacy protection for its users has been put in place by anonymizing the data. All information that would be used to personally identify any of the users has been removed. The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. through a data license agreement with its users. We will be using data from the past twelve months spanning from April 2022 to March 2023.
